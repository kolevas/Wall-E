#  YOLOv8n Object-Collecting Robot

This project runs a **YOLOv8n** (nano) object detection model on a **Raspberry Pi-powered robot** to detect and collect four specific types of objects in real time.

---

## üîç Object Detection & Collection

The robot is equipped to:

- Detect and classify:
  - `blue_ball`
  - `green_cube`
  - `red_ball`
  - `red_cube`
- Move toward detected objects
- Check if the object is grabbable based on size
- Collect the object using a motorized grabbing mechanism

---

##  Model Training

The YOLOv8n model is trained on a separate computer and then transferred to the Raspberry Pi for inference.

**Training repository:**  
 [kolevas/Object-detection-model](https://github.com/kolevas/Object-detection-model) (this repository contains more info about the model itself and its performance)
